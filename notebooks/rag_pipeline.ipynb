       " 'Game Setup:': '- The game is played on a 3x3 grid. - Player 1 uses the symbol \"X\" and Player 2 uses the symbol \"O\". - Players take turns placing their symbol in one of the empty squares on the grid. ',\n",
       " 'How to Play:': '1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid. 2. Player 1 (X) makes the ﬁrst move by placing their symbol in any of the 9 squares. 3. Player 2 (O) then places their symbol in one of the remaining empty squares. 4. Players continue to alternate turns until one player achieves a winning combination or the grid is full. ',\n",
       " 'Winning the Game:': '- A player wins by placing three of their symbols in a row, which can be: - Horizontally: Any of the three horizontal rows. - Vertically: Any of the three vertical columns. - Diagonally: Either of the two diagonal lines from corner to corner.  Draw: - The game is considered a draw if all 9 squares are ﬁlled and neither player has aligned three of their symbols in a row.',\n",
       " 'Game Strategy:': '- First Move:  The center square is often considered the best opening move for Player 1, as it provides the most opportunities to create a winning combination. - Blocking:  If your opponent is close to winning (e.g., they have two in a row), you should place your symbol in the empty square to block their move. - Forks:  Creating a situation where you have two potential winning moves on your next turn is a strong strategy, as it forces your opponent to block one, allowing you to win with the other. Advanced Tactics: - Double Fork:  A situation where you create two forks simultaneously, making it impossible for your opponent to block both. - Center Control:  Maintaining control of the center square often leads to more winning opportunities. ',\n",
       " 'End of Game:': '- The game ends when either a player wins or the grid is completely ﬁlled with no winner. - Players can choose to play multiple rounds and keep score of wins, losses, and draws. Multiplayer Mode: - In multiplayer mode, two human players alternate turns. - If playing against an AI, the AI will take over Player 2’s role and will make decisions based on predeﬁned strategies. Single Player Mode: - The player competes against an AI agent. - The AI agent’s diﬃculty can be adjusted to make it more challenging. Example Game: ``` |   | X | O | ----------- | X | O | X | O ----------- O |   | X ``` - In the above example, Player 1 (X) wins with a diagonal line.'}"
